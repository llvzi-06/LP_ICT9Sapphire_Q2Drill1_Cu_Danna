                      <h5> Bitcoin </h5>
                      <p> In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper “Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” and introduced the first fully functional and reliable blockchain-based decentralized payments system that can also be used as a store of value, just like gold. </p>

                      <h5> Dogecoin </h5>
                      <p>  a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time. It is considered both the first "meme coin", and more specifically the first "dog coin".</p>

                      <h5> Litecoin </h5>
                      <p> the second-oldest cryptocurrency, created from a fork from the Bitcoin protocol in 2011 to make a blockchain network that would be able to accommodate a wider range of transactional requirements. LTC, created by former Google engineer Charlie Lee, is one of the first “altcoins” — a name given to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin.</p>

                      <p> NB is a utility token created by Binance, a crypto exchange that launched in 2017. It combines elements of both currency and utility tokens. BNB can be used to pay for goods and services within and outside of the network. BNB is also used to pay network gas fees on Binance’s smart contract blockchain, BNB Chain.</p>
